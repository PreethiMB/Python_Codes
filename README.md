# Python_Codes
This repository contains the codes written in Jupyter Notebooks.
Mostly codes here are pertaining to plotting graphs. 
These are a part of a project that I was involved with and sharing the csv files or any data is not permitted.
The goal of these codes is to practice producing graphs and use them for further tweaking when needed.

**Watch this space for scripts on Google Earth Engine Python API.
